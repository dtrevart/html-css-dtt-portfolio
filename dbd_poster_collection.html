        Dead by Daylight is, well, one of the games of all time. I was never really
        into this genre of game, but my friends always tried to push me to play it.
        Eventually I gave in, and I hated it! After playing it more, it became more tolerable,
        and I don't even hate it that much anymore (don't tell anyone I said that, though).
        One of the things that made me enjoy the game more was playing killer instead of survivor.
        For those who don't know, Dead by Daylight is an asymmetrical horror game where 1 killer
        tries to stop a group of 4 survivors from escaping. From what I've heard, survivor used
        to be dramatically stronger than killer, and overtime due to balancing, killer has slowly
        powercrept survivors, making it much easier for them to "win".
        <br>
        <br>
        Something that I've really liked about the game is the design of (most of) their original
        killers. One of the ones I was really interested in was the Plague, since I literally hadn't
        ever played against here, so I unlocked her in game to try her out. 
        <br>
        <br>
        During this time, I was getting a ton of poster design styles and inspiration posts
        on Instagram and Pinterest, and I really wanted to try them out just to get some practice
        with more unique styles. Since I was really enjoying Plague, I decided to make one of her.
        I showed my friends, and they really liked it, so I asked if there were any characters
        they'd like to see a poster of, and they said Spirit and Trickster. From there,
        I had it in my head I was going to make a collection of posters, but 3 didn't seem
        like a good amount, so I decided to do my favorite character design-wise, the Singularity.
        <br>
        <br>
        The depiction of the killers are all from in-game screen captures of the characters, 
        whether its from the player perspective, lore tabs, or gameplay trailers. There a lot of
        small details that reference the characters, whether it be the chapter they came out in
        or some random flavor text from an add-on. I tried to keep each within the spirit of the
        character, staying within the characters theme, like the Magazine Cover style for Trickster
        or the worn and somewhat ancient paper to depict ancestory for Spirit.
