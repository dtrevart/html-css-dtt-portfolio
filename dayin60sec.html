        <p>
        This film was made for my Visual Storytelling class, as we were all tasked to make a film of our day
        in 60 seconds. My first thought was, "I don't do anything interesting, how the hell am I supposed to fill
        up 60 seconds with that?" and that's what I thought for weeks leading up to filming. When I make something,
        I want it to have meaning, but at first, I just couldn't see a way to make meaning from a meaningless day.
        But that's when I found it.
        <br>
        <br>
        When doing research for this project, I found a lot of these type of films seemed to have a happy feel,
        showing off all sorts of things people do. I just kepting thinking to myself, "How do people live 
        like this everyday?" and that's when it dawned on me: they don't. Most days are boring. Most days feel
        meaingless. Most days just go by and we forget about them as we move onto the next. We only remember the
        really good days and the really bad ones.
        <br>
        <br>
        With this basis, I decided to write a script (with the help of my girlfriend, thanks Avery!) to
        help layout how to get the message I wanted to come across in such a short amount of time. While 
        there was a lot of cutting and simplifying, I don't feel like it comes off as rushed.
        <br>
        <br>
        One of my favorite parts of the film is the music. I've taught myself to play piano to some degree,
        and one of the songs I've learned is
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQq98YPV8yk">Moral of the Story by Ashe</a>
        , and it seemed like a perfect backing for the film. The song has a meloncholy feel, and by
        missing and playing incorrect notes while I'm spiraling, it sounds beautiful.
        <br>
        <br>
        As for editing, I have never experienced more technical difficulties. From my SD card corrupting not once, but twice,
        the camera I was using deciding to not work because it "didn't" have a battery in it while it 
        was actively powered on thanks to the battery inside of it, Premiere Pro continuously crashing, and my
        PC acting like it was on its last leg, it's a miracle that this film even exists.
