        <p>
            1Fish was born out of a small multiples assignment in my Branding and Packaging class. 
            We were challenged to create several distinct marks that still felt like part of a larger 
            whole. I wanted to design something cohesive yet flexible—unified under a simple but memorable 
            name: 1Fish. The name itself plays with the idea of a singular identity amidst variation, 
            which became the guiding principle for the visual system.
        <br>
        <div class="fish-row">
            <img class="fish-img" src="./assets/1Fish/Presentation-01.jpg"  onclick="openImage(this)" alt="Original concepts for 1Fish, including various elements such as turtles and jellyfish, as well as the geometric fish icons.">
            <img class="fish-img" src="./assets/1Fish/Presentation-02.jpg"  onclick="openImage(this)" alt="Typography work and original fish icon to be filled with the small multiples.">
        </div>
        <p>
            From the beginning, I knew I wanted to explore an aquatic theme. I played around 
            with ideas involving jellyfish, turtles, and other sea creatures, but I eventually 
            landed on these geometric fish. Their simple forms made them ideal building blocks 
            for a cohesive visual system. I also explored custom typography for the brand name, 
            incorporating a fish into the type itself thanks to some much needed feedback from my 
            classmates!
        </p>
        <div class="fish-row">
            <img class="fish-img" src="./assets/1Fish/Presentation-03.jpg"  onclick="openImage(this)" alt="Small multiples variation, including six geometric fish figures filing up the original fish icon, all in black.">
            <img class="fish-img" src="./assets/1Fish/Presentation-04.jpg" onclick="openImage(this)" alt="Small multiples variation, including six geometric fish figures filing up the original fish icon, all in white against a black background.">
            <img class="fish-img" src="./assets/1Fish/Presentation-05.jpg" onclick="openImage(this)" alt="Small multiples variation, including six geometric fish figures filing up the original fish icon, in an analogous color scheme of purples and blues.">
            <img class="fish-img" src="./assets/1Fish/Presentation-06.jpg" onclick="openImage(this)" alt="Small multiples variation, including six geometric fish figures filing up the original fish icon, in a triatic color scheme of red, blue, and green">
        </div>
        <p>
            While this look leans toward a clean, corporate aesthetic, that structure gave 
            me room to focus on consistency in form, scale, and rhythm throughout the logo. The 
            result is a design that feels professional and modern, tied together by a shared shape 
            language and visual tone. Though 1Fish doesn't exist as a real brand, the process was a 
            great exercise in building branding systems that could stretch across multiple applications.
        <br>
        <br>
            That said, there were a few elements I wasn't completely sold on. The “1” in the logo 
            sometimes reads more like a “7,” which created a bit of confusion. I also wasn't fully 
            satisfied with the color palette. Part of the assignment involved using specific color 
            schemes, but I felt mine didn't hit the mark. Some of the fish forms, like the square, 
            diamond, and oval ones, also didn't sit right with me. Their uneven use of negative 
            space made them stand out awkwardly from the rest.
        </p>
        <div class="fish-row">
            <img class="fish-img" src="./assets/1Fish/Presentation-07.jpg" onclick="openImage(this)" alt="Refined branding assets, including an updated color palette with a black, green, orange, and white, updated geometric fish, and pattern, and a refined text logo.">
            <img class="fish-img" src="./assets/1Fish/Presentation-08.jpg" onclick="openImage(this)" alt="Finalized logo for the brand, including the geometric fish in the background with the updated fish icon logo taking center stage in orange, with the updated text logo to the right.">
        </div>
        <p>
            The final version features a cleaner logo, refined typography, and a more cohesive 
            brand identity. I replaced the rounded edges in the type with flatter, sharper forms 
            to better match the geometric fish. I also edited the “1” to remove some of the awkward 
            overhang, which helped it read much more clearly. A classmate suggested tweaks to the main 
            fish icon to make it more recognizable, and I ran with that feedback to create a stronger 
            symbol. I removed the small multiples from the main logo and used them as a background pattern 
            instead. Lastly, I updated the color scheme to one that feels much more aligned with the brand's 
            tone.
