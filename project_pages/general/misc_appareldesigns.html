        <p>
            Designing apparel, whether shirts, stickers, or other small physical pieces, has always been something 
            I've wanted to explore, but for a long time I wasn't sure how to approach it. Being out 
            of college for a while now, I've been especially conscious of not letting my skills stagnate, 
            particularly while navigating the ongoing job search. One of the ways I've chosen to stay creatively 
            active and continue developing my design skills is by creating custom designs for friends and family, 
            and the holiday season felt like the perfect opportunity to do just that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each design in this collection is inspired by something personal and meaningful to the person it was created for. 
            Rather than designing for a hypothetical audience, I focused on translating individual interests, memories, and inside 
            jokes into wearable pieces. For example, one of my friends is a huge fan of Astarion from Baldur's Gate 3. 
            While the character has appeared in other projects before and they already own physical merchandise, 
            I knew they wanted something they could actually wear. This felt like the ideal moment to create a design 
            that could live beyond a screen or shelf and become part of their everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although graphic design technically falls under the umbrella of art, hand-drawn work 
            has always been something I found intimidating. Since beginning my graphic design journey at 
            Lyndon in January of 2023, I've made a conscious effort to push myself outside of purely digital 
            workflows and incorporate physical, hand-drawn elements into my work. Looking back, I often wish 
            I had explored this approach earlier, especially on projects like my OMORI cards, which were entirely 
            built using the pen tool. Now that I'm more comfortable using tools like Image Trace, mixing traditional 
            and digital mediums feels far more natural and accessible, and honestly, it's become one of my favorite 
            parts of the process. From my early projects a few years ago, to my Hamlet poster in Spring 2025, and 
            now to these designs at the end of 2025, I can clearly see the growth in both my confidence and my voice.
        </p>
        <p>
            The “Woof.” shirt was created for my sister and is a literal interpretation of her dog, Nala. 
            This piece ended up being my personal favorite of the group, as the simplicity of the illustration 
            allows it to feel playful, charming, and instantly readable, especially in person. While the 
            dog is intentionally generic enough to be interpreted as almost any pet, the added bees and 
            butterfly give it a lighthearted, decorative quality that turns it into a small, wearable moment 
            rather than a strict portrait.
        </p>
        <p>
            “3 Little Birds” follows a similarly personal origin. My mom has always loved a decorative bird 
            plate from Pier One Imports, which features four birds. I chose to reinterpret the design with three birds 
            instead, referencing the Bob Marley song “Three Little Birds,” specifically the lyric “three little birds on my doorstep,” 
            which my dad often sings in a joking voice. To accommodate this change, two of the original bird designs were 
            merged, and I intentionally drew the birds in a loose, messy style to keep the illustration feeling warm and 
            imperfect. The text and doorstep were also hand-drawn, with the scribble tool in Illustrator helping preserve that 
            rough, organic quality for the coloring of the door.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Vermont shirt was designed for one of my siblings who no longer lives in the state but still holds it 
            close to their heart. Knowing how much they love nature, and how skilled they are at bird calls, I felt 
            it was important to include the state bird, the Hermit Thrush, which they immediately recognized 
            when I showed them the design. I expanded on that idea by incorporating other state symbols, 
            such as red clover and the Monarch Butterfly, and styled them as cut-out elements. This 
            approach paired well with a cut-out letter pack I found and helped reinforce the handmade, 
            collage-like feel I wanted the piece to have.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final design in this wave is the Rigatoni bag, which also expanded into pins and stickers. 
            Our family dog is named Rigatoni - Rigs for short - and while we all adore him, one of my sisters 
            has always had a particularly strong soft spot for him. I wasn't entirely sure a shirt would be 
            something they'd want, but I still wanted to create something practical and usable, which led 
            me to the idea of a tote bag. I initially worried that the slightly awkward, goofy angle I chose 
            for Rigs' head (which just so happens to be the same angle I photograph him from most often) might be 
            hard to read, but it ended up translating clearly and adding to the charm of the piece. The 
            surrounding rigatoni noodles became the perfect finishing detail, tying the design together both 
            visually and conceptually.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, this project feels like an important turning point in how I approach hand-drawn work. 
            While I still want to continue diversifying my skills, especially with what I have planned for 2026, 
            it was important to me to spend time solidifying my voice and learning how to lean into it. This 
            collection felt like a fitting way to close out the year: a mix of experimentation, personal storytelling, 
            and design made with intention for people who matter to me. Even though the process was occasionally 
            stressful, I'm genuinely glad I took the time to see it through.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            *NOTE - this project page will be changed in the future. These designs are going
            to be used for a different project, but I still wanted to find a place to show them
            off in the mean time. In addition, due to time constraints, I have not created mockups
            for every design. Please check back soon for more updates!
