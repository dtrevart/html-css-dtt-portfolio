        In the fall of 2024, the VTSU Wellness Center came to our class asking if we could
        redesign a logo and brand identity for them, as each campus had their own individual
        identity, but they weren't coherent of cohesive with each other. They mainly wanted it
        to give off wellness, as well as fit into the VTSU brand identity. From there, I created
        a creative brief and mood board to get a sense of the direction I wanted to go with.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Creative Brief Pages</h1>
        </p> 
    <table width=100%>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="./assets/Clients/VTSU_Wellness/CreativeBrief1.png" alt="Creative Brief Page 1"></td>
            <td><img src="./assets/Clients/VTSU_Wellness/CreativeBrief2.png" alt="Creative Brief Page 2"></td>
            <td><img src="./assets/Clients/VTSU_Wellness/CreativeBrief3.png" alt="Creative Brief Page 3"></td>
            <td><img src="./assets/Clients/VTSU_Wellness/CreativeBrief4.png" alt="Creative Brief Page 4"></td>
            <td><img src="./assets/Clients/VTSU_Wellness/CreativeBrief5.png" alt="Creative Brief Page 5"></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        While constructing the branding, there were some themes I had kept in mind. The main theme
        was having one main logo made up of 4 individual parts, directly relating to how VTSU is
        made up of 4 colleges, being Castleton University, Vermont Technical College, and Northern
        Vermont University, which was made up of Johnson State College and Lyndon State College.
        Alongside this, I wanted each campus to have their own identities represented, something
        I think that was lost while VTSU's identity was being created. The other themes were general
        wellness themes, having some figure that resembles a human, as well as having some resemblance
        of a heart and plants, being a clover in this case, to connect it more with growth and other
        similar ideas, as this theme came up quite a bit while doing research. In my creative breif,
        you can see that I included colors from every campus, and I ended up scrapping the Northern
        Vermont University colors in the end, as the school wasn't around very long, and I felt that
        the individual campus colors captured more identity.
